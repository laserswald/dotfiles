Lighting:
    Very complex process. 
    It bounces, refracts and is ubiquitous
    *VERY HARD TO RENDER EFFECTIVELY*

    Approximations:
        "if it looks good, it IS good"
    
    Two components:
        Source properties:
            Color, Shape, Direction
        Object properties:
            Material, Geometry, Absorption

    Reflections can reflect foreverrrrr
    but we can't do that..
    
    Directional light:
        (a point far away) 
        only the direction matters, not the position.
        intensity = acos(Normal * Light)

    Components:
        Diffusion:
            the way light falls off an object

        Specular:
            Shininess 

        Ambient:
            Light simulating global illumination

        Emitted:
            glowy
    
    final color is composed of may things:
        base object color
        light color
        textures     

    Light source directions:
        Omni-directional from point
        directional angle 
        directional parallel rays 

    Lighting vectors:
        l = incoming light vector
        n = normal of the plane/vertex
        r = reflection vector
        v = viewpoint

    Diffusion:
        Contribution that a light has on the surface, regardless of viewing direction.
        Diffuse surfaces could bounce in any direction.

        Lambertian reflectance: 
            diffuse = n . l * c_d * l_d

    Blinn-Phong Reflection:
        h = v + l

        final_color = (n . h)^s * c_s * l_s
        S is the shininess factor: bigger it is, the smaller the reflected shine is 
    
    Ambience and Emission:
        Just add the vectors together

    Final color: 
        add the diffuse, specular, ambient and emit
        for multiple lights, calculate them seperately and then sum them
