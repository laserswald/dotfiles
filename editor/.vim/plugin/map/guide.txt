Mappings

In general, I would like my mappings to work kind of like Spacemacs.

Most common operation is just <space><key>. 
Then the most common is <space><key><key>. 


b: buffer (de
    n:
c: control
f: file
    r: run
g: git (default: commit)
p: project
    b: build
t: tags
u: unite
v: settings and toggles
    w: toggle showing whitespace
    b: toggle background color
    e: edit vimrc
    r: reload vimrc and all plugins
    i: install plugins
    u: upgrade plugins
w: window (default: switch to last window)
    f: focus
    =: equalize
    s: split
    v: split vertically
